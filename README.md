# Abstract Factory Design Pattern in C#

## Overview

The Abstract Factory Pattern is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

This pattern is useful when:

A system needs to be independent of how its objects are created.

A system should be configured with multiple families of objects.

Objects need to be used together, and enforcing this relationship is important.

## Benefits

✅ Ensures consistency across related objects.
✅ Promotes scalability by allowing new product families.
✅ Reduces code duplication and dependency on specific implementations.

## When to Use

When you need to create related objects together.

When you want to enforce a consistent set of objects.

When object creation should be abstracted from the client.
